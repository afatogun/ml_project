Temporary compound relocation is required because: • The approved location has the same gradient and access issues as the original substation site. • The new location provides safer, more secure access with reduced cut/fill. • While temporary, the compound must safely accommodate offices, welfare facilities, storage, and staff parking until reinstatement after construction The proposed change does not alter the overall scale, use or purpose of the proposed development and will not give rise to any additional environmental or visual impacts.
